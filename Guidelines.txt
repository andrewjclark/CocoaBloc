Guidelines for CocoaBloc
------------------------

1. API client methods
	a. Return a cold RACSignal that sends request(s) on subscription
	b. Include headerdoc comments outlining specific usage and parameters
	c. Verify that signal blocks use weak references when appropriate to avoid retain cycles
	d. Use -setNameWithFormat: on signals to provide debugging context
	e. Verify all variations of failure and success evaluate as expected, via unit tests.
	f. Use helpful comments in the implementation. Signal flow among other things can be very complex. Let's not make people work too hard if debugging is necessary.
